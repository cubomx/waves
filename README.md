## waves app
Mobile phone application for the learning of any Sign Language (by now only Mexican Sign Language).

The tools implemented are:

- ### `React Native`
- ### `Google Firebase` 

Before you do anything, you should go and do the [Environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

In the root directory, you can run the two different environments (Android & iOS), wit the next steps:

For initialize the React Native App:
### `npx react-native start`

If you want to compile and run the Android app:
### `npx react-native run-android`

If you want to compile and run the iOS app (if you have a Mac computer):
### `npx react-native run-ios`

This project (by February 22th) is still in progress :)
